    <h2>Storyline</h2>
   <p>
    Detective Sherlock Holmes resides in London in the twenty-first century, a place known for its mystery, crime, and dishonesty. 
    In times of desperation, the police turn to Mr. Sherlock Holmes and his non-traditional techniques of deduction to help them solve the case. 
    In one of his cases, a villain whose scheme threatens the entirety of England challenges Holmes and his companion Watson to a contest of cunning and might. 
    The story, which takes place in 1890, centers on Holmes and Watson's efforts to thwart a mysticist's scheme to seize power in Britain by what appear to be paranormal means.

<!--ABOUT THE AUTHOR-->
<div class="overview" id="storyline">
    <h2>About Sir Arthur Conan Doyle</h2>
   <p>
    The second child of ten children, Conan Doyle was born in Edinburgh to Catholic parents. 
    The drunkenness and eventual confinement to an asylum of his father had put the family in a precarious predicament. But Conan Doyle attended a number of schools in England and Austria with the support of wealthy family, 
    and he later graduated from the University of Edinburgh with a medical degree. 
    In medical school, Conan Doyle started penning short stories. The manuscript "The Haunted Grange of Goresthorpe," which dates back to the late 1870s, is his oldest known work. His first published story is "The Mystery of Sasassa Valley" (1879).<br><br>

There are multiple novels and 56 short stories featuring Sherlock Holmes. 
Joseph Bell, a forensic science pioneer and Conan Doyle's university tutor, served as an inspiration for the detective. 
Bell was able to determine his patients' conditions by paying close attention to even the smallest characteristics about them. 
Conan Doyle started sending short stories to The Strand Magazine, which had just launched. The detective's exploits gain popularity fast, increasing the journal's readership.<br><br>

However, Conan Doyle felt that the Holmes stories eclipsed his other works, thus he had mixed feelings about his invention. 
In "The Final Problem," the author attempted to avoid writing about the consulting detective by raising his fees and even putting Holmes to death (1893). 
Nevertheless, he had to bring the detective back due to popular demand.
